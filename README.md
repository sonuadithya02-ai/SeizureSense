# SeizureSense  
### Edge-Based Seizure Detection Wearable using ESP32-S3 and Quantized TFLite Micro

SeizureSense is an embedded edge-AI system designed for real-time seizure detection using physiological and motion signals. The system runs a quantized TensorFlow Lite Micro model directly on the ESP32-S3 microcontroller for low-latency, offline inference.

This project demonstrates embedded systems design, signal processing, TinyML deployment, and real-time decision logic on resource-constrained hardware.
